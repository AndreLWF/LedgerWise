- View all transactions across linked accounts in a single feed
- Works on web and iOS from the same codebase

```

---

## Running locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- A [Teller](https://teller.io) account with sandbox credentials (App ID + certificate files)

### Backend

Create `backend/.env` with the following:

```
TELLER_CERT_PATH=certs/certificate.pem
TELLER_KEY_PATH=certs/private_key.pem
TELLER_ENV=sandbox
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:8081"]
```

Place your Teller certificate files in `backend/certs/` (`certificate.pem` and `private_key.pem`), then:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
# API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Frontend (web)

Create `frontend/.env` with the following:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
EXPO_PUBLIC_TELLER_APP_ID=your_teller_app_id_here
```

Then:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npx expo start --web
# Opens at http://localhost:8081
```

### Frontend (iOS simulator)

```bash
cd frontend
npx expo start
# Press 'i' to open in iOS simulator
```

> **iOS simulator tip:** Go to **I/O → Keyboard → disable "Connect Hardware Keyboard"** in the Simulator menu bar, otherwise typing in the Teller Connect login form will cause the page to refresh.

### Teller sandbox credentials

When prompted by Teller Connect in sandbox mode, use:
- **Username:** `username`
- **Password:** `password`
